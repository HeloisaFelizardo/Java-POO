Let's redo the previous program for handling two liquid containers. 
This time we'll create a class Container, which is responsible for managing the contents of a container.

Container
Make a class called Container. The class must have a constructor which does not take any parameters, 
and the following methods:

public int contains() which returns the amount of liquid in a container as an integer.
public void add(int amount) which adds the amount of liquid given as a parameter to the container. 
If the amount is negative, no liquid is added.
A container can hold maximum of 100 units of liquid.

public void remove(int amount) which removes the amount of liquid given as a parameter from the container. 
If the amount is negative, no liquid is removed. A container can never hold less than 0 units of liquid.
public String toString() which returns the container as a string formatted "amount of liquid/100", for example "32/100".
The class should work as follows:

Container container = new Container();
System.out.println(container);

container.add(50);
System.out.println(container);
System.out.println(container.contains());

container.remove(60);
System.out.println(container);

container.add(200);
System.out.println(container);
Sample output
0/100
50/100
50
0/100
100/100

Functionality
Copy the user interface you implemented for the previous example, and modify it to use the new Container class. 
The main method in the class LiquidContainers2 must start the program.

Below is some sample output. The user interface should work as follows:

Sample output
First: 0/100
Second: 0/100
remove 10

First: 0/100
Second: 0/100
add 20

First: 20/100
Second: 0/100
remove 5

First: 20/100
Second: 0/100
move 15

First: 5/100
Second: 15/100
remove 5

First: 5/100
Second: 10/100
remove 20

First: 5/100
Second: 0/100
quit
