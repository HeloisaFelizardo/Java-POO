The exercise template contains the already familiar classes Book and Program. 
In the class Program implement the following class methods:

public static void printValues(HashMap<String,Book> hashmap), which prints all the values in the hashmap 
given as a parameter using
the toString method of the Book objects.

public static void printValueIfNameContains(HashMap<String,Book> hashmap, String text), which prints 
only the Books in the given hashmap which name contains the given string. You can find out the name of a 
Book with the method getName.
An example of using the class methods:

HashMap<String, Book> hashmap = new HashMap<>();
hashmap.put("sense", new Book("Sense and Sensibility", 1811, "..."));
hashmap.put("prejudice", new Book("Pride and prejudice", 1813, "...."));

printValues(hashmap);
System.out.println("---");
printValueIfNameContains(hashmap, "prejud");
Sample output

Name: Pride and prejudice (1813)
Contents: ...
Name: Sense and Sensibility (1811)
Contents: ...
---
Name: Pride and prejudice (1813)
Contents: ...
NB! The order of the output may vary. The implementation of a hashmap does not guarantee the order of the objects in it.
